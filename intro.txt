You're awake again. Back at your apartment, though you don't remember getting here.

Your awakening is owed to the dusty sunlight streaming through your curtains. It hurts when you open your eyes. You are thirsty. It doesn't feel like you showered. You think you had fun, though. You always do at Wednesday night karaoke!
