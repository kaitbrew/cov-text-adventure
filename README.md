Hi!
Thanks for taking the time to check out my work. I started this project as a way to talk about a difficult time in my life. Currently, there is a system to enter a name and select stats (with error handling) as well as the beginnings of the framework for how the scenes change. The idea is that each "scene" has multiple-choice options to take you to a different scene based on varying backend items. The scene and response prompt text are pulled from notepad files.
